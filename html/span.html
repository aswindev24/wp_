<p>aju <span style="color:red">(Dulquer Salmaan)</span> and Kannan are childhood buddies, who can kill for each other. They’re young, reckless and undisputed rulers of the Kotha of the 1980s. However, unlike other gangsters, these boys and their gang won’t do drugs or deal in it. But like all good things must come to an end, their brotherly bond comes undone, after a sudden betrayal by one of them. It also has a little something to do with the entry of Raju’s lady love Tara (Aishwarya Lekshmi). Things turn quite messy and bloody, as the two friends turn against each other and Kotha is no longer the same.
It’s a textbook gangster saga with oodles of swag, <span style="color:red">bloodshed and brutal action ruling the screenplay. Director Abhilash Joshiy and Abhilash N. Chandran </span>ensure their narrative is packed with twists, turns and relentless fights. All the action plays out in the fictional town of Kotha in a decidedly retro setting (by art director Manoj Arakkal) and is <span style="color:blue">brought to life by Nimish Ravi’s visually stunning cinematography. Add to that, a thumping background score by Jakes Bejoy is like icing on the cake.</span> Clearly, it’s more about optics and the immersive experience than anything else.</p>
